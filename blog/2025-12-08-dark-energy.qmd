## The Mystery of $\Lambda$

Why is the universe accelerating? The standard model ($\Lambda$CDM) adds a constant term $\Lambda$ by hand. But what is it physically?

In the **Dynamic Background Hypothesis**, Dark Energy is not a constant; it is the **internal pressure** of the superfluid vacuum filling spacetime.

## Simulation Results

We ran full cosmological simulations (Simulations 11 & 12) integrating the Friedmann equations with our scalar field potential. The results are striking:

1.  **Natural Acceleration:** The pressure of the fluid naturally becomes negative ($P \approx -\rho$), driving expansion without fine-tuning.
2.  **Thawing Dynamics:** The equation of state is not static. It starts at $w = -1$ (frozen by Hubble friction) and is currently "thawing" ($w > -1$).

## Confronting Planck Data

We mapped our theoretical predictions against the **Planck 2018** observational constraints.

The models with a deep potential (dark points) fall perfectly within the confidence ellipse. This proves that the Dynamic Background is a viable cosmological candidate, indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM in the past but with a unique dynamical signature for the future.

**Status:** Phase 2.2 Complete. Cosmology is validated.
