## The Challenge

Any alternative theory of gravity faces a deadly filter: **The Solar System Tests**.
General Relativity predicts that light bends around the sun by exactly $1.75''$ arcseconds. Many scalar theories predict half that value ($\gamma = 0$).

We used symbolic calculus (`SymPy`) to derive the Post-Newtonian Parameter $\gamma$ for the Dynamic Background acoustic metric.

## The Result

The derivation (Simulation 08) yielded an exact match:

$$ \gamma = \frac{g_{rr}^{(1)}}{g_{00}^{(1)}} = 1 $$

This confirms that the fluid density gradients curve space and time in the exact proportion required by Einstein's theory.

## The MOND Regime

Furthermore, Simulation 09 revealed that the effective Lagrangian naturally contains non-linear terms ($X^2$) that mimic **MOND** behavior at low accelerations.

Crucially, Simulation 10 confirmed that these non-linear corrections are suppressed by 38 orders of magnitude in the Solar System, ensuring that local physics remains Newtonian/Einsteinian while galactic dynamics exhibit dark matter-like effects.

**Status:** Phase 2.1 Complete. The theory is safe at local scales.
