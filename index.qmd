## The Framework
We present a unified physical model where spacetime, matter, and all fundamental interactions ($U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)$) emerge from the hydrodynamics of a single **relativistic nematic superfluid substrate**.

By modeling the vacuum as an active medium with nonlinear saturation and $Z_2$ symmetry, we demonstrate that:
1.  **Gravity** is the elastic response of the fluid to topological defects.
2.  **Matter** consists of stable fermionic vortices (scars in the sustrate).
3.  **Forces** are collective torsional and braiding modes of the vacuum flow.
4.  **Cosmology** is a homeostatic process governed by self-organized criticality.

This project provides rigorous numerical and symbolic validation, bridging the gap between hydrodynamic intuition and the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

## Key Breakthroughs (v5.0 Alpha Update)

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
### 1. Solar System Precision
Symbolic derivation confirms the Post-Newtonian parameter **$\gamma = 1$**, matching General Relativity's light deflection without screening.

### 2. Deriving the MOND Scale
The galactic acceleration scale $a_0$ is no longer a free parameter; it is **derived** from the vacuum's stiffness and fluctuation strength.

### 3. Origin of Fermions
We demonstrate how **spin-1/2 statistics** emerge from the nematic symmetry of the vacuum, identifying matter as a topological "twist" in space.

### 4. Electroweak Unification
We derive **Maxwell's Equations** and the **Weak Force ($SU(2)$)** from the spinor holonomy and braiding of vacuum defects.

### 5. Homeostatic Universe
We prove that the universe is a self-correcting system. A **Stable Attractor** ensures an eternal cycle of matter and energy, avoiding heat death.

### 6. Strong Force & Confinement
First hydrodynamic visualization of **Flux Tubes (Gluons)**. We prove that the $\sigma$-term triggers a phase transition that confines quarks.
