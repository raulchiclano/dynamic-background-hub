## The Framework
We present a unified physical model where spacetime, matter, and the dark sector emerge from the hydrodynamics of a single **relativistic nematic superfluid vacuum**.

By modeling the vacuum as a pre-geometric sustrate with nonlinear saturation and $Z_2$ symmetry, we demonstrate that:
1.  **Gravity** is the acoustic metric of the fluid's density fluctuations.
2.  **Matter** consists of stable topological defects (fermionic vortices).
3.  **Light & Forces** are collective torsional modes (vorticity) of the background.
4.  **Spacetime** is an emergent equilibrium state governed by vacuum stiffness.

This project provides rigorous numerical and symbolic validation, bridging the gap between hydrodynamic intuition and the Standard Model.

### 1. Solar System Precision
Symbolic derivation confirms the Post-Newtonian parameter **$\gamma = 1$**, matching General Relativity's light deflection without screening.

### 2. Deriving the MOND Scale
The galactic acceleration scale $a_0$ is no longer a free parameter; it is **derived** from the vacuum's stiffness and fluctuation strength.

### 3. Origin of Fermions
We demonstrate how **spin-1/2 statistics** emerge from the nematic symmetry of the vacuum, identifying matter as a topological "twist" in space.

### 4. Emergent Light & Lorentz
We derive **Maxwell's Equations** from vacuum vorticity and prove that **Lorentz Invariance** is a minimum energy state of the sustrate.
