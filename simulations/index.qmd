# Computational Proof of Concept

Welcome to the **Simulation Lab**. This repository contains the numerical and symbolic experiments validating the core tenets of the **Dynamic Background Hypothesis (DBH)**. 

Unlike traditional "Dark Sector" models, the DBH provides the "receipts" for its claims through open-source code. From the emergence of the MOND scale to the topological origin of fermions and the restoration of Lorentz invariance, these notebooks bridge the gap between abstract theory and physical reality.

## Research Pillars

### 1. Microphysics & Matter
We explore how elementary particles emerge as topological defects (vortices and hopfions) in a nematic superfluid. 
*   **Key Breakthrough:** The derivation of the **Berry Phase ($\pi$)**, proving the fermionic nature of vacuum defects.

### 2. Emergent Gravity & MOND
We derive the laws of gravitation not as fundamental postulates, but as the hydrodynamics of the vacuum.
*   **Key Breakthrough:** The analytical derivation of the **MOND scale ($a_0$)** from the vacuum's unified potential (Action v4).

### 3. Spacetime Structure & Gauge Fields
We demonstrate how the "stage" of the universe—spacetime itself—and the forces that inhabit it (Electromagnetism) are collective modes of the sustrate.
*   **Key Breakthrough:** The derivation of **Lorentz Invariance** as a minimum energy state and **Maxwell's Equations** from vacuum vorticity.

## Technical Note
Derivations are performed using `SymPy` for exact symbolic tensor calculus and `NumPy/SciPy` for numerical integrations of the Friedmann and Gross-Pitaevskii equations.
