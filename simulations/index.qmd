# Formal Validation of the Dynamic Background

This laboratory contains the computational core of the DBH. We have transitioned from a "Proof of Concept" to a **Formal Validation Suite**, where the hypothesis is subjected to rigorous symbolic and numerical testing.

## Methodology
Our validation framework operates on two complementary levels:

1.  **Symbolic Tensor Calculus:** Using `SymPy` to derive exact field equations, energy-momentum tensors, and the analytical emergence of the MOND scale ($a_0$).
2.  **Numerical Hydrodynamics:** Solving the relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii and FLRW equations using the **Split-Step Fourier Method** and high-precision ODE integrators.

## Key Milestones in v3.5
*   **Microphysics:** Emergence of spin-1/2 statistics from $Z_2$ nematic symmetry (Berry Phase $\pi$).
*   **Gravity:** Analytical derivation of the galactic transition scale $\rho_c = \sigma^2/4\beta^2$.
*   **Cosmology:** Mapping of the parameter space against Planck 2018 + BAO + SNe constraints.
