    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "If Lorentz invariance is an emergent equilibrium state, why is it so robust? This simulation quantifies the **energy cost** of deviating from the $c=1$ state. We aim to calculate the \"Restoration Module\" ($K_L$) of the vacuum—the \"spring constant\" that forces the universe back into a relativistic state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Methodology\n",
    "*   **Anisotropy Perturbation:** We introduce a deviation $\\epsilon$ in the spatial tetrads ($e_s = e_t(1+\\epsilon)$).\n",
    "*   **Energy Expansion:** We perform a Taylor expansion of the v4 Potential around the equilibrium state ($\\epsilon = 0$).\n",
    "*   **Stiffness Calculation:** We extract the second-order coefficient ($K_L$), which represents the vacuum's resistance to anisotropy."

    "## 3. Results & Interpretation\n",
    "The simulation reveals why the speed of light appears \"absolute\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Stable Minimum:** The energy $V(\\epsilon)$ has a positive quadratic term. This confirms that the Lorentz-invariant state ($c=1$) is a **global minimum of energy**. The universe \"wants\" to be relativistic.\n",
    "2.  **Ultra-Rigid Spacetime:** The restoration module $K_L$ is dominated by the $\\beta$ term. Since $\\beta$ represents the vacuum's stiffness at the Planck scale, $K_L$ is astronomically large.\n",
    "3.  **The \"Spring\" Analogy:** Breaking Lorentz invariance is like trying to bend a steel beam the size of a galaxy. The energy required to change the speed of light by even a fraction is so immense that, for all practical purposes, $c$ remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "We have successfully quantified the stability of the spacetime fabric. The Dynamic Background is not a \"loose\" fluid, but an **ultra-rigid self-correcting system**. Lorentz invariance is the inevitable result of the vacuum minimizing its internal stress.\n"
