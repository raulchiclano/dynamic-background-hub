Methodology\n\nSpace: Volumetric grid \\(64^3\\).\nTopological Construction: The Hopf Fibration (inverse stereographic projection from \\(S^3 \\to S^2\\)) was used to generate the initial field.\nVisualization: The low-density isosurface (the defect core) was extracted using the Marching Cubes algorithm and colored according to the local phase of the field.\n\n\n\n3. Observed Results\n\nToroidal Geometry: The low-density region forms a perfect closed torus (donut). This confirms that the defect is a vortex line closed upon itself.\nPhase Structure (Color): The existence of the toroidal structure mathematically implies a Hopf charge \\(Q_H=1\\). The phase field lines twist around the torus, providing the necessary topological stability to prevent collapse.\n\n\n\n4.

Results & Interpretation\nThe parameter scan provides a definitive test of the theory’s viability:\n\nThe “Sweet Spot” (Dark Points): Models with highly negative \\(\\alpha\\) (stronger potential curvature) cluster tightly around the \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM point \\((-1, 0)\\). These models fall well within the red confidence ellipse, proving that the Dynamic Background is fully consistent with Planck 2018 data.\nThe Thawing Signature: As the potential becomes shallower (lighter colors), the models drift into the Thawing Quintessence region (\\(w_0 &gt; -1, w_a &lt; 0\\)). This specific trajectory in the phase space acts as a “fingerprint” of the theory.\nNo Phantom Crossing: Crucially, no models fall into the “Phantom” region (\\(w &lt; -1\\)). The theory predicts a stable vacuum that does not lead to a “Big Rip.”",

Results & Interpretation\nThe simulation below visualizes the evolution of the field \\(\\Psi\\):\n\nDensity (Left Panel): A perfectly defined “hole” or zero-density core is observed in the center of the fluid.

Results & Interpretation\nThe simulation reveals two critical features of the Dynamic Background:\n\nNatural Transition (Left Panel): The model successfully recovers the standard cosmological history. At high redshifts (\\(z &gt; 1\\)), matter dominates the energy budget, allowing for structure formation. As the universe expands, the vacuum field \\(\\Psi\\) takes over, becoming the dominant component at \\(z \\approx 0.7\\).\nThawing Quintessence (Right Panel): Unlike a rigid Cosmological Constant (\\(w = -1\\)), the vacuum field exhibits thawing dynamics. It remains “frozen” at \\(w \\approx -1\\) during the early stages due to high Hubble friction, but as expansion slows down, the field begins to evolve, causing \\(w(z)\\) to increase slightly.",

    "text": "Symbolic Derivation of Einstein Tensor\n\n1. Objective\nTo analytically verify if the acoustic metric derived from the Dynamic Background generates a spacetime curvature compatible with gravity. Specifically, we aim to calculate the Einstein Tensor (\\(G_{\\mu\\nu}\\)) and check if its temporal component (\\(G_{00}\\)) depends on the Laplacian of the fluid density (\\(\\nabla^2 \\rho\\)), thus recovering the Poisson Equation of Newtonian gravity.\n\n\n2. Methodology\n\nTool: Symbolic tensor calculus with Python (SymPy).\nInput: Effective acoustic metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{\\rho}{c_s} [\\eta_{\\mu\\nu} + (c_s^2-1)v_\\mu v_\\nu]\\) in the static limit (\\(v=0\\)).\nProcess:\n\nCalculation of the Inverse Metric \\(g^{\\mu\\nu}\\).\nCalculation of Christoffel Symbols \\(\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}\\).\nCalculation of Ricci Tensor \\(R_{\\mu\\nu}\\) and Ricci Scalar \\(R\\).\nConstruction of Einstein Tensor \\(G_{\\mu\\nu} = R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\\mu\\nu}\\).\n\n\n\n\n3. Obtained Results\nThe script output shows that \\(G_{00}\\) contains terms proportional to: \\[ G_{00} \\propto A \\cdot \\nabla^2 \\rho + B \\cdot \\frac{(\\nabla \\rho)^2}{\\rho} \\] Where \\(\\nabla^2 \\rho = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial z^2}\\).\n\n\n4. Conclusion\nThe result confirms that emergent spacetime curvature is directly linked to the Background density distribution. * The term \\(\\nabla^2 \\rho\\) is the direct analogue of the mass source in Poisson’s Equation (\\(\\nabla^2 \\Phi \\propto \\rho_{matter}\\)). * This formally demonstrates that matter (density perturbation) generates gravity (curvature) in this model, validating the mathematical consistency of the hypothesis with General Relativity in the weak field limit.\n\n\nCode\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef derive_einstein_tensor():\n    # 1.

Results & Interpretation\nThe derivation reveals the geometric nature of the vacuum:\n\nSpacetime as a Crystal: The metric \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is not an empty stage but a manifestation of the vacuum’s internal stiffness. The result shows a perfectly diagonal metric, consistent with a flat Minkowski space in the absence of matter.\nThe Meaning of \\(c\\): The speed of light is revealed to be the ratio of elasticities of the vacuum. It is the speed at which the “nematic crystal” of space recovers its shape after a perturbation.\nEmergent Isotropy: While the tetrads could theoretically be different, the vacuum’s ground state (minimum energy) forces \\(e_s = e_t\\), leading to the universal constant \\(c=1\\).",
